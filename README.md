## Python-Challenge


## Usage

1. Python needs to be installed. 

2. The two csv files,'budget_data_csv' and 'election_data.csv,' need to be placed in the folder "Resources" of each folder: "PyBank" and "PyBoll."

3. Each folder "PyBank" and "PyBoll" contains a "Resources" folder with the csv file, an "analysis" folder with the text file containing the results, and a "main.py" file with the python script.

## Description 

This Python challenge analyzes the financial record of a dataset. This 'budget_data.csv' file contains two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses."  
The financial analysis calculates:

* The total number of months in the dataset
* The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
* The changes in "Profit/Losses" and the average of those changes
* The greatest increase in profits (date and ammount)
* The greatest decrease in profits (date and ammount)
